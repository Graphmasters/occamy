# Occamy

#### Resources

- The [design document](./documentation/design.md) contains the abstract design for an Occamy server. It is written
  independent of implementation and is a useful starting point to understanding the core concepts.

- The [examples module](./examples) contains example implementations of interfaces appearing in this module as well as
  some example use cases. This provides a practical demonstration on how different aspects of occamy work.

  It is recommended that new users start by copying the relevant code from the examples as a way to quickly get started.

- The [advice document](./documentation/advice.md) contains useful advice for using this library and implementing the
  required interfaces.
